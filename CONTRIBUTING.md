### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Proper Git Workflow

**ALWAYS follow this exact sequence to avoid conflicts:**

1. **Update your local main branch**
   ```bash

   git pull origin master
   ```

2. **Create a NEW branch from updated main**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/{issueNumber}-your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow coding guidelines
   - Update documentation if needed

### ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Don't commit to master branch directly**
- **Don't create new branches from old master**
- **Don't include previous commits in your PR**
